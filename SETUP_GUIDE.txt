E-COMMERCE SETUP GUIDE
================================

Your e-commerce application has been successfully transformed to use:
✓ Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)
✓ Admin Authentication
✓ Product Management System
✓ Cloudinary Image Uploads
✓ Stripe Payment Integration

================================
IMPORTANT: FIRST-TIME SETUP
================================

1. CREATE ADMIN USER
-------------------
You need to create an admin user in Supabase to access the admin dashboard.

Steps:
a. Go to: https://ickpueztkxvccthivoqi.supabase.co
b. Login to your Supabase dashboard
c. Go to Authentication > Users
d. Click "Add User" or "Invite User"
e. Enter admin email and password
f. After user is created, go to SQL Editor
g. Run this SQL to make the user an admin:

   INSERT INTO admin_users (id, email)
   VALUES (
     '[USER_ID_FROM_AUTH_USERS]',
     '[ADMIN_EMAIL]'
   );

   Replace [USER_ID_FROM_AUTH_USERS] with the actual user ID from auth.users table
   Replace [ADMIN_EMAIL] with the admin's email

2. ACCESS ADMIN PANEL
-------------------
- Go to your website footer
- Look for the small "Admin" link (intentionally hidden with low opacity)
- Click it to go to /admin/login
- Login with the admin credentials you created
- You'll be redirected to /admin/dashboard

3. MANAGE PRODUCTS
-------------------
From the admin dashboard you can:
- Add new products
- Edit existing products
- Delete products
- Upload product images to Cloudinary
- Set product prices, descriptions, features
- Mark products as featured or in/out of stock

================================
CLOUDINARY SETUP
================================

The image upload is currently using Cloudinary's demo account.
For production, you should:

1. Create a Cloudinary account at: https://cloudinary.com
2. Get your upload preset and cloud name
3. Update ProductForm.jsx line 38-43:

   const response = await fetch(
     'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/image/upload',
     {
       method: 'POST',
       body: formData,
     }
   );

4. Update the upload_preset in ProductForm.jsx line 36:
   formData.append('upload_preset', 'YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESET');

================================
STRIPE SETUP (OPTIONAL)
================================

The Stripe integration is currently a simulation.
For real payments, you need to:

1. Create a Stripe account at: https://stripe.com
2. Get your Stripe API keys
3. Follow this guide: https://bolt.new/setup/stripe
4. Implement server-side checkout using Supabase Edge Functions

================================
DATABASE STRUCTURE
================================

Tables:
- categories: Product categories
- products: All products
- admin_users: Admin authentication records

The database has been seeded with 2 sample products.
You can add more products through the admin panel.

================================
FEATURES OVERVIEW
================================

Public Features:
- Browse products by category
- Search products
- View product details
- Add to cart
- Wishlist functionality
- Checkout (simulated payment)

Admin Features:
- Secure login
- Add/Edit/Delete products

================================
NOTES
================================

================================
NEXT STEPS
